title: xoxofest, and a reintroduction
---

i had the opportunity to go to my first (and last [only?]) xoxofest this year.
it was magical. the talks were incredible, i got to see some old pals from
glitch (and one from glitch _and_ webflow!), the new people i met there were
great, portland food was delicious, the transit was surprisingly pretty great
for the west coast... i could go on. tbh though, i felt a bit like an imposter.
i was surrounded by cool people working on interesting projects, and i'm... a
software engineer?

something that i noticed over the weekend that really stuck with me was how
other people were introducing themselves. a large number of people i met said
"i'm X, but my day job is Y" and i've just... never felt worthy of doing that?
i've often felt like an imposter after graduating design school because i went
directly into software engineering since that's what had been paying the bills
through school, but like... i _am_ a designer and a maker.

i studied digital design and game dev. i've made video games. i've written
ttrpgs. i've built i don't know how many electronics projects. and honestly...
i'm pretty good at those things, too. what more do i need to identify with some
of the most fulfilling, vulnerable, and creative things that i do? why do i feel
obligated to identify with, build community around, write about, and devote my
free time to a profession that just pays my bills, and keep the things that
bring me joy to myself? why do i feel like i can't _seriously_ do these things,
and that they're _just a hobby?_

after i got home and somewhat settled back in (tangent: i started adderall for
my adhd again last monday after discontinuing it in early 2020 because my
psychiatrist didn't do virtual appointments and tennessee required you to use
paper prescriptions for controlled medications so i, adhd girlie, had to keep up
with _paper prescriptions???_ what a joke. anyways i'm tired as hell because
i've been sleeping like shit for 4 years without it), i updated my website and
swapped the first and second paragraphs of my intro. what was "i'm a software
engineer and _for fun_ i make games and _play around with_ hobby electronics" is
now "i'm a game designer and electronics maker, and as a day job, i'm a software
engineer." these aren't my hobbies; they're my art.

i also deleted a boring-ass blog post that i wrote a few months ago about some
typescript bullshit that i slogged through writing but wrote it nonetheless
because i needed to get _some_ creative energy out and i felt obligated to make
it about my day job because \~productivity\~... whatever. i'm gonna start
sharing some hobby electronics projects i've built over the last few years,
starting with a simple post about a (potentially over-engineered) light that i
built for my wife for her yarn cabinet that _automatically turns on when she
opens the door_. very wild stuff here. i'm also working on a game currently, and
in a few weeks i hope to share some more info on that soon. maybe some sketches,
definitely some design and direction ideas, hopefully some code eventually.
hell, i might even take a page from [jenn @
livelaugh.blog](https://livelaugh.blog/) and occasionally blog about
candlemaking, since i had to pick that up recently because i was spending a bit
too much money on candles and had wayyy too many empty cute containers around
the apartment.

i'm excited. :)
