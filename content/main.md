hi! i'm a senior software engineer on the enterprise team at webflow. previously
i worked at glitch building the code editor and other developer tools, and
before that i was architecting a new website in react for an automotive parts
retailer chain. a long time ago i was also building websites and calendaring
systems for public libraries across north america.

outside of work i play guitar and experiment with hobby electronics,
specifically with guitar pedals, keyboards, and retro console related things.
