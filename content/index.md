hi! i'm phoebe (she/they), a senior software engineer on the enterprise team at webflow.
previously i worked at glitch building the code editor and other developer
tools, and before that i was architecting a new website in react for an
automotive parts retailer chain. a long time ago i was also building websites
and calendaring systems for public libraries across north america.

outside of work i design tabletop rpgs, play guitar, and experiment with hobby
electronics, specifically guitar pedals, keyboards (the computer kind), and
retro console related things. i'll blog about them eventually.

trans rights are human rights. black lives matter. fascism is a loser ideology.
