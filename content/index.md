hi! i'm phoebe (she/her), a game designer and hobby electronics maker in
brooklyn. in the past i've designed tabletop rpgs, and currently i'm working on
a game for the [playdate](https://play.date/) (more info on the blog soon). i
also love building keyboards (the computer kind) and guitar pedals.

as a day job, i'm a senior software engineer on the enterprise team at webflow.
previously i worked at glitch building the code editor and other developer
tools, and before that i was architecting a new website in react for an
automotive parts retailer chain. a long time ago i was also building websites
and calendaring systems for public libraries across north america.

trans rights are human rights, black lives matter, and fascism is a loser
ideology.
