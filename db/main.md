hi! i'm a senior software engineer on the enterprise team at webflow. previously i worked at glitch building the code editor and other developer tools, and before that i was
architecting a new website in react for an automotive parts retailer chain. a long time ago i was also building websites and calendaring systems for
public libraries across north america.

in my free time, i play music (mostly electric bass) and fiddle with hobby electronics. i'm always creating
things and struggling to fit way too many projects into one lifetime.
