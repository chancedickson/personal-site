hi! i'm a senior software engineer on the enterprise team at webflow. previously
i worked at glitch building the code editor and other developer tools, and
before that i was architecting a new website in react for an automotive parts
retailer chain. a long time ago i was also building websites and calendaring
systems for public libraries across north america.

outside of work i stream on twitch 3 days a week. my current schedule is tuesday 7&en;10PM,
thursday 7&en;10PM, and saturday 2&en;5PM (all times EST). most of the time i play
games, but sometimes i code and fiddle with hobby electronics. you can find my
up-to-date schedule on my twitch profile.
