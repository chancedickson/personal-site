hi! i'm a senior product engineer at glitch, primarily building the code editor and other developer tools. previously i worked on
building a new website in react for an automotive parts retailer chain as well as building websites and calendaring systems for
public libraries across north america.

in my free time, i play music (mostly electric guitar, some electric bass) and fiddle with hobby electronics. i'm always creating
things and struggling to fit way too many projects into one lifetime.
